he course also features six YouTube videos of Nick giving a lesson in front of some new Google employees. These 

make it feel like he’s actually there teaching you every feature and trick, and I’d highly recommend watching 

all of them as you go through the lessons. Some of the videos are longish (~50m) so this is something you want 

to do when you’re sitting down and focused.

And to really get your feet wet, there are also downloadable samples puzzles and challenges that go along with 

the lessons, so you can actually practice coding along with the Googlers in his class. They’re all pretty basic 

— most took me less than 5m — but they’re a great chance to practice what you’ve learned. Plus you get the 
love
satisfaction that comes with solving puzzles and successfully moving through the class. love
